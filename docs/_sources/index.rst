PrefSampling
============

PrefSampling is a light Python library that provides preference samplers.
These are algorithms that generate random preferences based on precisely
defined statistical cultures. We consider different type of preferences:

* Ordinal: preferences are expressed as rankings of the alternatives;
* Approval: preferences are expressed by indicating a set of approved alternatives.
