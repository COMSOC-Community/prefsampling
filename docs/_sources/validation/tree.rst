Tree Samplers
=============

We present below the validation tests we ran for samplers that produce trees.

Schröder Trees by Alonso, Rémy, Schott (1997)
---------------------------------------------

This sampler is supposed to yield a uniform distribution, but does not in practice.

Schröder Trees by Lescanne (2022)
---------------------------------

This sampler has unknown probability distribution but is efficient for large numbers of leaves.

Uniform Schröder Trees
----------------------

This sampler yields a uniform probability distribution but enumerates all trees (and is thus slow).
