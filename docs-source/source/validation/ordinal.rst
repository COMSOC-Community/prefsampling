Ordinal Samplers
================

We present below the validation tests we ran for ordinal samplers.

Impartial
---------

Under the impartial model, all ranks are equally likely to be generated.

Impartial Anonymous
-------------------

With the impartial anonymous culture, every multisets of votes--an anonymous profile---are
equally likely to be generated. Note here that we are discussing anonymous profiles and
not ranks.

Stratification
--------------

Under the stratification model, only the ranks that are ''stratified'' can occur.

When the weight is 0 or 1, there is a single class, and thus, we fall back to the
impartial culture.

We the weight is different from 0 and 1, we obtain more interesting distributions over
the ranks.

Urn
---

The probability distribution governing an urn model is well documented.
See https://www.jstor.org/stable/30024551 for instance.

Once again, we are here discussing anonymous profiles and not ranks.

When `alpha` is equal to `1 / m!`, we fall back to the case of the impartial anonymous
culture.

For other values of `alpha`, different probability distributions are obtained.

Mallows
-------

The probability distribution generated by a Mallows' model is also well known.
See https://jmlr.org/papers/v15/lu14a.html for instance.

.. image:: validation_plots/ordinal/mallows_0.8.png

  :alt: Observed versus theoretical frequencies for Mallow's model with phi=0.8

When `phi` is one,  we fall back to the impartial culture.

Plackett-Luce
-------------

The properties of the Plackett-Luce model have also been described at length.
See https://proceedings.mlr.press/v48/zhaob16.html for example.

When all candidates have the same quality (i.e., all `alpha` values are equal),
we fall back to the impartial culture case.

Otherwise, different distribution can be observed.

Euclidean
---------

In the case of the Euclidean model, nothing is known about the distribution over
ranks that they generate.

Single-Peaked
-------------

For single-peaked samplers, the one proposed by
`Walsh (2015) <https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.02766>`_ ensures that all single-peaked
rank are equally likely to be generated.

The model proposed by `Conitzer (2009) <https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3449>`_ yields
a different probability distribution.In this distribution, the probability of observing
a given single-peaked rank is equal to  `1/m * (1/2)**dist_peak_to_end` where `m` is the
number of candidates and `dist_peak_to_end` is the minimum distance from to peak
to an end of the axis (i.e., candidates `0` or `m - 1`).

For the single-peaked on a circle model, all single-peaked on a circle rank are
equally likely to be generated.

Single-Crossing
---------------

For the single-crossing samplers, the impartial is designed to yield a uniform probability
distribution over all non-isomorphic single-crossing profiles.

The efficient sampler has unknown probability distribution.

Group-Separable
---------------

The sampler is supposed to produce a uniform distribution, but it does not...
