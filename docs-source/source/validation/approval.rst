Approval Samplers
=================

We present below the validation tests we ran for approval samplers.

Impartial
---------

:py:func:`prefsampling.approval.impartial`

In the impartial model every candidate has the same probability :code:`p` of being approved. Thus,
the probability of generating an approval ballot of length :code:`k` follows a binomial distribution
of parameters :code:`p` and :code:`k`.

Resampling
----------

:py:func:`prefsampling.approval.resampling`

See the work of `Szufa et al. (2022) <https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0071.pdf>`_
for more details on this model.

Disjoint Resampling
-------------------

:py:func:`prefsampling.approval.disjoint_resampling`

See  the work of `Szufa et al. (2022) <https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0071.pdf>`_
for more details on this model.

Noise
-----

:py:func:`prefsampling.approval.noise`

The probability distribution generated by the noise model based on the Hamming distance.

Identity
--------

:py:func:`prefsampling.approval.identity`

The identity sampler only samples a single ballot. This is what we observe here.
