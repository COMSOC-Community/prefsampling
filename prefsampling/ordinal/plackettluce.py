    """
    Generates ordinal votes according to Plackett-Luce model.

    This model is parameterised by a vector `alphas` intuitively indicating a quality for each
    candidate. A vote is generated in `m` steps (`m` being the number of candidates). The vote is
    filled up from most preferred to least preferred candidate. For the initial draw, the
    probability of selecting a candidate is equal to its quality (normalised). Then, this candidate
    is removed and the quality are re-normalised.

    A collection of `num_voters` vote is generated independently and identically following the
    process described above.

    For a similar model, see the :py:func:`~prefsampling.ordinal.didi.didi` model.

    Parameters
    ----------
        num_voters : int
            Number of Voters.
        num_candidates : int
            Number of Candidates.
        alphas : list[float]
            List of model parameters (quality of the candidates).
        seed : int, default: :code:`None`
            Seed for numpy random number generator.

    Returns
    -------
        list[list[int]]
            Ordinal votes.

    Examples
    --------

        .. testcode::

            from prefsampling.ordinal import plackett_luce

            # Sample from a Plackett-Luce model with 2 voters and 3 candidates, the qualities of
            # candidates are 0.5, 0.2, and 0.1.
            plackett_luce(2, 3, (0.5, 0.2, 0.1))

            # For reproducibility, you can set the seed.
            plackett_luce(2, 3, (5, 2, 0.7), seed=1002)

            # Don't forget to provide a quality for all candidates
            try:
                plackett_luce(2, 3, (0.5, 0.2))
            except ValueError:
                pass

            # And all quality scores need to be strictly positive
            try:
                plackett_luce(2, 3, (0.5, 0.2, -0.4))
            except ValueError:
                pass
            try:
                plackett_luce(2, 3, (0.5, 0.2, 0))
            except ValueError:
                pass

    Validation
    ----------

        The probability distribution governing the Plackett-Luce model is well documented.
        Specifically, given :math:`n` agents and :math:`m` candidates and a vector of candidates
        qualities :math:`\\mathbf{\\alpha} = (\\alpha_1, \\ldots, \\alpha_m)`, the probability of
        generating a ranking :math:`a_{i_1} \\succ a_{i_2} \\succ \\cdots \\succ a_{i_m}`
        is equal to:

        .. math::

            \\frac{\\alpha_{i_1}}{1} \\times \\frac{\\alpha_{i_2}}{\\sum_{p > 1}\\alpha_{i_p}}
            \\times \\cdots \\times \\frac{\\alpha_{i_{m-1}}}{\\alpha_{i_{m-1}} + \\alpha_{i_m}}.

        We test that the observed frequencies of rankings aligns with the theoretical probability
        distribution.

        When all values in :code:`alphas` are equal, we are supposed to observe a uniform
        distribution over all rankings.
