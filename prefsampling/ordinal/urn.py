def urn(
    num_voters: int, num_candidates: int, alpha: float, seed: int = None
) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Generates votes following the PÃ³lya-Eggenberger urn culture. The process is as follows. The urn
    is initially empty and votes are generated one after the other, in turns. When generating a
    vote, the following happens. With a probability of 1/(urn_size + 1), the vote is selected
    uniformly at random (following an impartial culture). With probability `1/urn_size` a vote
    from the urn is selected uniformly at random. In both cases, the vote is put back in the urn
    together with `alpha * m!` copies of the vote (where `m` is the number of candidates).

    Note that for a given number of voters, votes are not sampled independently.

    Parameters
    ----------
        num_voters: int
            Number of voters
        num_candidates: int
            Number of candidates
        alpha: float
            The dispersion coefficient (`alpha * m!` copies of a vote are put back in the urn after
            a draw). Must be non-negative.
        seed: int, default: :code:`None`
            The seed for the random number generator.

    Returns
    -------
        np.ndarray
            The votes
