def urn(

) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Generates votes following the PÃ³lya-Eggenberger urn culture. The process is as follows. The urn
    is initially empty and votes are generated one after the other, in turns. When generating a
    vote, the following happens. With a probability of 1/(urn_size + 1), the vote is selected
    uniformly at random (following an impartial culture). With probability `1/urn_size` a vote
    from the urn is selected uniformly at random. In both cases, the vote is put back in the urn
    together with `alpha * m!` copies of the vote (where `m` is the number of candidates).

    Note that for a given number of voters, votes are not sampled independently.

    Parameters
    ----------
        num_voters: int
            Number of voters
        num_candidates: int
            Number of candidates
        alpha: float
            The dispersion coefficient (`alpha * m!` copies of a vote are put back in the urn after
            a draw). Must be non-negative.
        seed: int, default: :code:`None`
            The seed for the random number generator.

    Returns
    -------
        np.ndarray
            The votes

    Validation
    ----------

        The probability distribution governing an urn model is well documented.

        When :code:`alpha = 1 / m!`, we fall back to the case of the impartial anonymous
        culture. For other values of :code:`alpha`, different probability distributions are
        obtained.

        With the impartial anonymous culture, every multisets of votes--an anonymous profile---are
        equally likely to be generated. Note here that we are discussing anonymous profiles and
        not ranks.

    Examples
    --------

        .. testcode::

            from prefsampling.ordinal import urn

            # Sample from an urn model with 2 voters and 3 candidate. Urn parameter is 0.5.
            urn(2, 3, 0.5)

            # For reproducibility, you can set the seed.
            urn(2, 3, 4, seed=1002)

            # Passing a negative alpha will fail
            try:
                urn(2, 3, -0.5)
            except ValueError:
                pass
