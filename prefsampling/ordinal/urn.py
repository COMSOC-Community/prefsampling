    """
    Generates votes following the PÃ³lya-Eggenberger urn culture. The process is a follows. The urn
    is initially empty and votes are generated one after the other, in turns. When generating a
    vote, the following happens. With probability `1/(urn_size + 1)` the vote is simply selected
    uniformly at random (following an impartial culture). With probability `1/urn_size` a vote
    from the urn is selected uniformly at random. In both cases, the vote is put back in the urn
    together with `alpha * m!` copies of the vote (where `m` is the number of alternatives).

    Parameters
    ----------
    num_voters: int
        The number of voters
    num_candidates: int
        The number of candidates
    alpha: float
        The dispersion coefficient. Must be non-negative.
    seed: int
        The seed for the random number generator.

    Returns
    -------
        np.ndarray
            The votes
