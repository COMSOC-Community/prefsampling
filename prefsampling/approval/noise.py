    """
    Generates approval votes under the noise model. This model is parameterised by a central
    vote. Approval ballots are then generated based on their distance to the central vote.
    Specifically, a vote is generated with probability :code:`phi` to the power distance between
    the vote and the central vote.

    A collection of `num_voters` vote is generated independently and identically following the
    process described above.

    For an analogous sampler generating ordinal ballots, see
    :py:func:`~prefsampling.ordinal.mallows.mallows`.

    Parameters
    ----------
        num_voters : int
            Number of Voters.
        num_candidates : int
            Number of Candidates.
        phi : float
            Noise model parameter, denoting the noise.
        rel_size_central_vote: float
            The relative size of the central vote, if no central vote is provided, the central
            vote is selected uniformly at random among all subsets of candidates of size
            `⌊rel_size_central_vote * num_candidates⌋`.
        distance : :py:class:`~prefsampling.approval.noise.SetDistance`, default: :py:const:`~prefsampling.approval.noise.SetDistance.HAMMING`
           Distance used to compare a given vote to the central vote.
        central_vote : set
            The central vote. Ignored if :code:`impartial_central_vote = True`.
        impartial_central_vote: bool, default: :code:`False`
            If true, the central vote is sampled from :py:func:`~prefsampling.approval.impartial`
            with the same value for the parameter :code:`p` as passed to this sampler.
        seed : int
            Seed for numpy random number generator.

    Returns
    -------
        list[set]
            Approval votes.

    Examples
    --------

            # For reproducibility, you can set the seed.

            # Parameter phi needs to be in [0, 1]

                pass
            try:
                noise(2, 3, -0.2, 0.2)
            except ValueError:
                pass

            # Parameter p needs to be in [0, 1]

                noise(2, 3, 0.5, 1.2)

                pass
            try:
                noise(2, 3, 0.5, -0.2)

    Validation
    ----------

            :width: 800
            :alt: Observed versus theoretical frequencies for a noise model with phi=0.75

        When :code:`phi` is equal to 0, then a single approval ballot should receive all the
        probability mass.

            :width: 800
            :alt: Observed versus theoretical frequencies for a noise model with phi=0

        When :code:`phi` is equal to 1, then we are supposed to obtain a uniform distribution over
        all approval ballots.
