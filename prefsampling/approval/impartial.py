    """
    Generates approval votes from impartial culture.

    Under the approval culture, when generating a single vote, each candidate has the same
    probability :code:`p` of being approved. This models ensures that the average number of
    approved candidate per voter is `p * num_candidate`.

    A collection of `num_voters` vote is generated independently and identically following the
    process described above.

    Parameters
    ----------
        num_voters : int
            Number of Voters.
        num_candidates : int
            Number of Candidates.
        p : float
            Probability of approving of any given candidates.
        seed : int
            Seed for numpy random number generator.

    Returns
    -------
        list[set]
            Approval votes.

    Raises
    ------
        ValueError
            When `p` not in [0,1] interval.

    Generates approval votes from impartial culture with constant size.

    Under this culture, all ballots are of size `⌊rel_num_approvals * num_candidates⌋`. The ballot

    ----------

        num_candidates : int

        rel_num_approvals : float
            Number of approvals per ballot, i.e., size of the approval ballot.
