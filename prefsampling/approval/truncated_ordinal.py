    """
    Generates approval votes by truncating ordinal votes sampled from a given ordinal sampler.

    The process is as follows: ordinal votes are sampled from the ordinal sampler. These votes are
    then truncated in a way that each approval vote consists in the
    `rel_num_approvals * num_candidates` first candidates of the ordinal vote.

    Parameters
    ----------
        num_voters: int
            Number of voters
        num_candidates: int
            Number of candidates
        rel_num_approvals: float,
            Ratio of approved candidates.
        ordinal_sampler: Callable
            The ordinal sampler to be used.
        ordinal_sampler_parameters: dict
            The arguments passed ot the ordinal sampler. The num_voters, num_candidates and seed
            parameters are overriden by those passed to this function.
        seed : int
            Seed for numpy random number generator.

    Returns
    -------
        list[set[int]]
            Approval votes
