    """

    Generates votes following the Pólya-Eggenberger urn culture. The process is as follows. The urn
    is initially empty and votes are generated one after the other, in turns. When generating a
    vote, the following happens. With a probability of 1/(urn_size + 1),an approval ballots in
    which all candidates have the same probability `p` of being approved is selected at random
    (following an impartial culture as in the
    :py:func:`~prefsampling.approval.impartial` function). With probability
    `1/urn_size` a vote from the urn is selected uniformly at random. In both cases, the vote is
    put back in the urn together with `alpha * (2**m)` copies of the vote (where `m` is the number
    of candidates).

    Note that for a given number of voters, votes are not sampled independently.

    Parameters
    ----------
        num_voters: int
            Number of voters
        num_candidates: int
            Number of candidates
        p : float
            Proportion of approved candidates in a ballot.
        alpha: float
            The dispersion coefficient (`alpha * m!` copies of a vote are put back in the urn after
            a draw). Must be non-negative.
        seed: int, default: :code:`None`
            The seed for the random number generator.

    Returns
    -------
