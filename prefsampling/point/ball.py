    Samples points uniformly at random in a ball. This function can also handle spheres and spheres
    of different width per dimensions, leading to distributions that are not really balls. For
    instance, you can obtain an ellipse by providing two different widths in the 2D case.

    Parameters
    ----------
        num_points: int
            The number of points to sample.
        num_dimensions: int
            The number of dimensions for the ball.
        center_point: Iterable[float]
            The coordinates of the center point of the ball. It needs to have one coordinate per
            dimension.
        widths: float | Iterable[float], default: :code:`1`
            The width of the ball. If a single value is given, the width is applied to all
            dimensions. In case multiple values are given, they are applied to each dimension
            independently.
        only_envelope: bool, default: :code:`False`
            If set to :code:`True` only points on the envelope of the ball (the corresponding
            sphere) are sampled, and not in the inside.
        seed : int, default: :code:`None`
            Seed for numpy random number generator.

    Returns
    -------
        np.ndarray
            The coordinates of the :code:`num_points` points that have been sampled.
