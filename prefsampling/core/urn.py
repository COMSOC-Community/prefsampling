    """
    Generates votes following a PÃ³lya-Eggenberger urn process. This is the general scheme that is
    used, for instance, in :py:func:`~prefsampling.ordinal.urn`.

    When generating a sample the following happens. With a probability of 1/(urn_size + 1), the
    a base case sample is generated (based on :code:`base_case_sampler`). With probability
    `1/urn_size` a element of the urn is selected uniformly at random. In both cases, the element is
    put back in the urn together with `alpha * num_different_balls` copies of the vote
    (where `num_different_balls` is the number different outcomes of the :code:`base_case_sampler`
    function).

    Parameters
    ----------
        num_samples: int
            The number of samples to select
        alpha: float
            The dispersion coefficient (`alpha * m!` copies of a vote are put back in the urn after
            a draw). Must be non-negative.
        base_case_sampler: Callable
            A function that returns a sample to add in the urn in the base case
        rng

    Returns
