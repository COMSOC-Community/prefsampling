            Number of Candidates.
        num_dimensions: int
            The number of dimensions to use. Using this argument is mandatory when passing a space
            as argument. If you pass samplers as arguments and use the num_dimensions, then, the
            value of num_dimensions is passed as a kwarg to the samplers.
        voters_positions: :py:class:`~prefsampling.core.euclidean.EuclideanSpace` | Callable | Iterable[Iterable[float]]
            The positions of the voters, or a way to determine them. If an Iterable is passed,
            then it is assumed to be the positions themselves. Otherwise, it is assumed that a
            sampler for the positions is passed. It can be either the nickname of a sampler---when
            passing a :py:class:`~prefsampling.core.euclidean.EuclideanSpace`; or a sampler.
            A sampler is a function that takes as keywords arguments: 'num_points',
            'num_dimensions', and 'seed'. Additional arguments can be provided with by using the
            :code:`voters_positions_args` argument.
        candidates_positions: :py:class:`~prefsampling.core.euclidean.EuclideanSpace` | Callable | Iterable[Iterable[float]]
            The positions of the candidates, or a way to determine them. If an Iterable is passed,
            then it is assumed to be the positions themselves. Otherwise, it is assumed that a
            sampler for the positions is passed. It can be either the nickname of a sampler---when
            passing a :py:class:`~prefsampling.core.euclidean.EuclideanSpace`; or a sampler.
            A sampler is a function that takes as keywords arguments: 'num_points',
            'num_dimensions', and 'seed'. Additional arguments can be provided with by using the
            :code:`candidates_positions_args` argument.
        voters_positions_args: dict, default: :code:`dict()`
            Additional keyword arguments passed to the :code:`voters_positions` sampler when the
            latter is a Callable.
        candidates_positions_args: dict, default: :code:`dict()`
            Additional keyword arguments passed to the :code:`candidates_positions` sampler when the
            latter is a Callable.
        seed : int, default: :code:`None`
            Seed for numpy random number generator. Also passed to the point samplers if
            a value is provided.

    Returns
    -------
        tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray]
