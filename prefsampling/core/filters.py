    Resamples the votes by using them as the central vote of a given sampler. The outcome is

    Votes are copied before being returned to avoid loss of data.

    Parameters
    ----------
        votes : list[set[int]] or np.ndarray
            Approval or ordinal votes.
        sampler : Callable
            The sampler used to resample the votes.
        sampler_parameters : dict
            Dictionary passed as keyword parameters of the sampler. Number of voters or central vote
             of this dictionary are not taken into account.
        num_candidates : int, defaults: :code:`None`
            The number of candidates, useful for incomplete ballots in which this information cannot
            be retrieved from the votes.
